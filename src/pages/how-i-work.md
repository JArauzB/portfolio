# How I Work

## Agile Methodology & Sprint-Based Development

I follow **Agile methodology** with a sprint-based workflow to deliver projects efficiently and iteratively. This approach ensures flexibility, continuous improvement, and alignment with client needs throughout the development process.

## My Agile Workflow

### Sprint Planning

Each project is broken down into manageable **2-week sprints**. During sprint planning:

- **Define goals**: Identify clear, achievable objectives for the sprint
- **Break down tasks**: Decompose features into smaller, actionable tasks
- **Estimate effort**: Assign realistic time estimates to each task
- **Prioritize backlog**: Focus on high-value items that deliver the most impact

### Daily Standups

I maintain visibility and momentum through regular check-ins:

- Review progress on current tasks
- Identify blockers or dependencies
- Adjust priorities as needed
- Keep stakeholders informed

### Sprint Execution

During the sprint, I focus on:

- **Incremental development**: Build features in small, testable increments
- **Continuous testing**: Validate functionality early and often
- **Code reviews**: Ensure quality through peer review and best practices
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear technical and user documentation

### Sprint Review & Retrospective

At the end of each sprint:

- **Demo deliverables**: Present working features to stakeholders
- **Gather feedback**: Incorporate user insights into the next sprint
- **Reflect and improve**: Identify what went well and areas for improvement
- **Update backlog**: Refine upcoming tasks based on learnings

## Tools & Practices

### Project Management
- **GitLab Boards / Jira**: Track tasks, sprints, and project progress
- **Scrum boards**: Visualize workflow (Backlog → In Progress → Done)

### Version Control
- **Git branching strategy**: Feature branches, pull requests, and main branch protection
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment on every commit

### Collaboration
- **Weekly sprint meetings**: Align with team and stakeholders
- **Asynchronous communication**: Documentation and detailed commit messages
- **Pair programming**: Tackle complex problems collaboratively

## Benefits of Agile in My Work

✅ **Flexibility**: Adapt quickly to changing requirements  
✅ **Transparency**: Stakeholders see progress continuously  
✅ **Quality**: Regular testing and code reviews ensure reliability  
✅ **Efficiency**: Focused sprints prevent scope creep and maintain momentum  
✅ **Continuous improvement**: Each sprint refines processes and deliverables

## Example Sprint Workflow

Here's a typical 2-week sprint breakdown:

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| **Day 1** | Sprint planning, backlog refinement |
| **Day 2-3** | Feature development (backend) |
| **Day 4-5** | Feature development (frontend) |
| **Day 6-7** | Testing, bug fixes |
| **Day 8-9** | Integration, code review |
| **Day 10** | Final testing, documentation |
| **Day 11** | Sprint review, stakeholder demo |
| **Day 12** | Retrospective, next sprint planning |

This structured approach has proven effective across projects ranging from mobile apps to automation workflows, ensuring consistent delivery of high-quality software.
